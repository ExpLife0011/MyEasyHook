## MyEasyHook
I just write this project to learn the famous Win32 Hook "EasyHook".
I just copy EasyHoo to make me understand the EasyHook more better.
If you want to know more about EasyHook, pleast to visit it's home.

##Update note
###2-26-2017
I stopped learning the project temporarily after I completed learning the remote inject of EasyHook.Recently I start learning to the local hook of the EasyHook. 
Perhaps I can find an another problem in the procedure again. :)
